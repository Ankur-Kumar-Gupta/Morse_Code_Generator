# Morse_Code_Generator

CLI (command line interface) software to generate Morse code of the given message. 


Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. The International Morse Code encodes the 26 English letters A through Z, some non-English letters, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters.

<b>Morse Code for SOS, the standard emergency signal.</b>(above)


Its a command line interface program fully written in C++, in which we made use of nested if-else, some inbuilt windows library functions for screen clearing and changing screen and text color. Through this program we have seen how to create a function and how to call it, how getline(), strcmp() and length() functions work, how goto; statement works and how and why to use fflush() function in your program.
